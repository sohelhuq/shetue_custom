This `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file is designed for running automated tests on Shetue MultiBiz ERPNext using Frappe Bench. It's set up to be triggered by pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch of your repository. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

1. **Checkout code**: The workflow starts by checking out the latest changes from the repository.

2. **Set up Python environment**: It sets up a Python environment with Python 3.8 using the `actions/setup-python` action.

3. **Install dependencies**: It installs pip and then installs Flake8 for code quality checks.

4. **Run tests**: The workflow runs Frappe Bench's test command to execute all the tests in your ERPNext instance.

This setup ensures that you can catch issues early, and it helps maintain a clean and consistent development environment.
